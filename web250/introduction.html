            <b>Academic background:</b> I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Public Health from East Carolina University. 
            After graduating from ECU, my goal was to go to Physical Therapy School. 
            However, after several failed attempts to enroll in a PT program in NC, I decided to make a career change. 
            I stumbled on CPCC’s software development track and it is by far one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life. 
            This is my last semester at CPCC and I cannot wait to graduate :)

            Now, I enjoy coding in my free s I'm Taking & Why:
