        <p class="main">
            <br>
                I, Augustine Akyaw agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in 
                my Spring 2023 Web250 Database Driven Websites with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
                
            </br>    
                I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, 
                and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            <br>  
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
                As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. 
            </br>
            
            <br>
            Signed: Augustine Akyaw, January 16th, 2023
            </br>
