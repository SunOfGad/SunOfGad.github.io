                    I understand that all work that I do on my school 
                    and personal website will be publicly available to the world, 
                    and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, 
                    or that I wish to keep private.

                    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, 
                    not logins or showing up for class.
                    As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
