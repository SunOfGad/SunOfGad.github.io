        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal background:</b> Grew up in Ghana, moved to the US when I was 14. 
                I have lived in Charlotte since my arrival in 2005. I love to play soccer during my free time. 
                I once coached a girls U11 team for Charlotte Soccer Academy and I had a blast.
            </li>
            <li><b>Professional background:</b> I currently work as a Fleet Service Agent for American Airlines, 
                and as a Software Engineer for Bank of America. I am very new to this role, 
                and I hope the knowledge gained in this class helps me in my current role at BofA.
            </li>
            <li><b>Academic background:</b> I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Public Health from East Carolina University. 
                After graduating from ECU, my goal was to go to Physical Therapy School. 
                However, after several failed attempts to enroll in a PT program in NC, I decided to make a career change. 
                I stumbled on CPCC’s software development track and it is by far one of the best 
                decisions I’ve ever made in my life. This is my last semester at CPCC and I cannot wait to graduate :)</li>
            <li><b>Background in this Subject:</b>  When I first started taking programming classes, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. 
                I found it very difficult at first, however, I never stopped practicing and learning small chunks of information at a time. 
                Now, I enjoy coding in my free time. </li>
            
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why: </b> 
                <ul>
                <li><strong>WEB-250-N801: Database Driven Websites </strong>– 
                    Taking this course as a substitute for my Capstone Project Course. </li>
                <li><strong>CSC-249 : Data Structures & Algorithms – </strong>  Very important subject to learn in IT. 
                I also need this class in order to graduate.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b>  I am the only person who is technologically savvy in my family. </li>
            <li><b>I'd also like to Share:</b> I plan to go back to Ghana and open a Technological Institute to help teach young children about coding and computer hardware. 
                Finally, one of my goals is to design my own website.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Primary Computer Platform: </b> Windows 10 at home and at work. 
                I am a big fan of Lenovo thinkpads. 
                I also have an HP laptop for work which I love so much.
